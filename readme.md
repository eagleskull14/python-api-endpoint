# Python API Endpoint

A simple python + html duo that shows off API endpoints.

## Includes...

-   1 Free Python file that makes you and endpoint! (Port forwarding not included.)
-   More than 1 free html files! Use the build in keyboard, and (once i make it) a built in mouse!

## Usage

1. Download all the files, put it somewhere safe and that you can remember.
2. Find your IP, reserve it, and port forward it on 5000 (i think thats the defualt, if you are unsure run the python file and see what flask spits out.)
3. Using mostly anything, go to the url (http://(yourip):(5000 i think)) and use the different paths to do stuff!

Warning, this could be unsafe, so do whatever at your own risk
